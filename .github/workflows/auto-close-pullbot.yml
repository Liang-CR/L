            Thank you for your interest in keeping your fork updated. 
            
            However, we prefer that forks use the GitHub Actions workflow provided in this repository to sync with upstream changes. 
            
            Please disable PullBot and use the `sync.yml` workflow in your fork instead. This helps reduce notification noise for repository maintainers.
            
            This PR is being automatically closed.
